Needless to say, data manipulation ahead of machine learning process has to be done in order to maintain our machines' precision, etc. There are two kinds of manipulations that are used nowadays due to data set's distribution property. In other words, whether or not the data set follows Gaussian distribution plays a critical role in selecting which data manpulation process we are going to use.
